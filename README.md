## So here I am with my SECOND mini project.

Check out what I've been doing for the last month and what's inside of it.

I recreated my own copy of homepage of Wikipedia:



What I have learned by finishing this project is firm understanding of skeleton of HTML so to say: how it's structured from top to bottom. Generally - now I've got it on way more advanced level 

then it was before. It was realy tremendous experience at learning how to position content to your liking. I learned so and SO much about how to nest blocks (box-sizing) one into another and 

how to make them position and behave the way I want them to behave. Nevertheless, I still have black spots to how clearly position them within one another so - more to learn :D This project is

 an achievement to me and I regret no minute to sitting and just making this clone-page. Indeed it sometimes gets boring to this stuff but just when you really struggling to handle something. 
 
 As long as you keep on pushing - the rock is moving and you get the excitement back :)
